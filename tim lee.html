            <h2>What is Pure Silk?</h2>
            <p>Pure silk is a natural fiber, produced by silkworms. Being a worm-made product, the pure silk fibers are non-vegan and prone to decomposing naturally if left untreated. These fibers are processed to wash off the protein coating and woven to
                prepare the pure silk fabrics. Popular silk sarees like Kanjivaram and Banarasi are made from processed silk fabrics having a better shelf-life.
